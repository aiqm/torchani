TorchANI is a pytorch implementation of ANI. It is currently under alpha
release, which means, the API is not stable yet. If you find a bug of TorchANI,
or have some feature request, feel free to open an issue on GitHub, or send us
a pull request.

TorchANI is tested against the (usually) latest PyTorch version

## Install TorchANI

### Using conda (BROKEN)

**TODO**: Support this again (currently only building from source works)

To install TorchANI using conda run:

```bash
conda create -n ani python=3.8
conda activate ani
# The following command is all one line
conda install \
    -c https://roitberg.chem.ufl.edu/projects/conda-packages-uf-gainesville \
    -c pytorch \
    -c nvidia \
    -c defaults \
    -c conda-forge \
    sandbox
```

Notes:

- The conda package is hosted at
  https://roitberg.chem.ufl.edu/projects/conda-packages-uf-gainesville only for
  internal use
- In the case where multiple updates were released within the same day, you may
  need to add a `--force-reinstall` flag instead of waiting for the next
  nightly update.

### Using pip (BROKEN)

**TODO**: Support this again (currently only building from source works)

## From source

To build install TorchANI directly from the GitHub repo run the following:

```bash
# Clone the repo and cd to the directory
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/roitberg-group/torchani_sandbox.git
cd ./torchani_sandbox

# Create a conda (or mamba) environment
# Note that environment.yaml contains many optional dependencies needed to
# build the extensions, build the documentation, and run tests and tools
# You can skip these if you are not planning to do that
conda env create -f ./environment.yaml

# Install torchani
pip install -v --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .

# Install CUDA and C++ extensions (optional)
# Use the "--ext-all-sms" flag instead of "--ext" if you want to build for all GPUs
pip install -v --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e . --global-option="--ext"

# Download files needed for testing and building the docs (optional)
bash ./download.sh

# Build the documentation (optional)
sphinx-build docs/src docs/build

# Manually run unit tests (optional)
cd ./tests
pytest -v .
```

Usually this process works for most use cases, but for more details regarding
building the CUDA and C++ extensions refer to [TorchANI CSRC](torchani/csrc).

## CUDA / C++ extensions

A CUDA extension for speeding up AEV calculations and a C++ extension for
parallelizing networks (MNP or Multi Net Parallel) using OpenMP are compiled by
default in the conda package. They have to be built manually if installed from
GitHub.

## Command Line Interface

Torchani provides an executable script, `torchani`, with some utilities. Check
usage by calling ``torchani --help``.

## Documentation (ONLY APPLIES TO PUBLIC REPO)

If you opened a pull request, you could see your generated documents at
https://aiqm.github.io/torchani-test-docs/ after you `docs` check succeed. Keep
in mind that this repository is only for the purpose of convenience of
development, and only keeps the latest push. The CI runing for other pull
requests might overwrite this repository. You could rerun the `docs` check to
overwrite this repo to your build.

## Notes to developers

- Never commit to the master branch directly. If you need to change something,
  create a new branch and submit a PR on GitHub.
- All the tests on GitHub must pass before your PR can be merged.
- Code review is required before merging a pull request.
