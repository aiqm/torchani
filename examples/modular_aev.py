Extending AEVs with custom terms
================================

TorchANI allows for modification and customization of the AEV features

# To begin with, let's first import the modules and setup devices we will use:

# This example is meant to show how to take advantage of the modular AEV implementation
# We will use these coordinates and species:

# to the AEVComputer, as long as the forward method has this form, it will work!
