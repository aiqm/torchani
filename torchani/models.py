"""The ANI model zoo that stores public ANI models.

Currently the model zoo has two models: ANI-1x and ANI-1ccx. The classes
of these two models are :class:`ANI1x` and :class:`ANI1ccx`,
these are subclasses of :class:`torch.nn.Module`.
To use the models just instantiate them and either
directly calculate energies or get an ASE calculator. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ani1x = torchani.models.ANI1x()
    # compute energy using ANI-1x model ensemble
    _, energies = ani1x((species, coordinates))
    ani1x.ase()  # get ASE Calculator using this ensemble
    # convert atom species from string to long tensor
    ani1x.species_to_tensor('CHHHH')

    model0 = ani1x[0]  # get the first model in the ensemble
    # compute energy using the first model in the ANI-1x model ensemble
    _, energies = model0((species, coordinates))
    model0.ase()  # get ASE Calculator using this model
    # convert atom species from string to long tensor
    model0.species_to_tensor('CHHHH')

Note that the class BuiltinModels can be accessed but it is deprecated and
shouldn't be used anymore.
