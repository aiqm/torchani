Computing Energy and Force Using Models Inside Model Zoo
========================================================

TorchANI has a model zoo trained by NeuroChem. These models are shipped with
TorchANI and can be used directly.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-12

To begin with, let's first import the modules we will use:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-15

.. code-block:: default

    import torch
    import torchani








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-17

Let's now manually specify the device we want TorchANI to run:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-19

.. code-block:: default

    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-29

Let's now load the built-in ANI-1ccx models. The builtin ANI-1ccx contains 8
models trained with diffrent initialization. Predicting the energy and force
using the average of the 8 models outperform using a single model, so it is
always recommended to use an ensemble, unless the speed of computation is an
issue in your application.

The ``periodic_table_index`` arguments tells TorchANI to use element index
in periodic table to index species. If not specified, you need to use
0, 1, 2, 3, ... to index species

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-31

.. code-block:: default

    model = torchani.models.ANI2x(periodic_table_index=True).to(device)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.16/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torchani-2.2.3-py3.8.egg/torchani/resources/




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-41

Now let's define the coordinate and species. If you just want to compute the
energy and force for a single structure like in this example, you need to
make the coordinate tensor has shape ``(1, Na, 3)`` and species has shape
``(1, Na)``, where ``Na`` is the number of atoms in the molecule, the
preceding ``1`` in the shape is here to support batch processing like in
training. If you have ``N`` different structures to compute, then make it
``N``.

.. note:: The coordinates are in Angstrom, and the energies you get are in Hartree

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-50

.. code-block:: default

    coordinates = torch.tensor([[[0.03192167, 0.00638559, 0.01301679],
                                 [-0.83140486, 0.39370209, -0.26395324],
                                 [-0.66518241, -0.84461308, 0.20759389],
                                 [0.45554739, 0.54289633, 0.81170881],
                                 [0.66091919, -0.16799635, -0.91037834]]],
                               requires_grad=True, device=device)
    # In periodic table, C = 6 and H = 1
    species = torch.tensor([[6, 1, 1, 1, 1]], device=device)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

Now let's compute energy and force:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-56

.. code-block:: default

    energy = model((species, coordinates)).energies
    derivative = torch.autograd.grad(energy.sum(), coordinates)[0]
    force = -derivative








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-58

And print to see the result:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-61

.. code-block:: default

    print('Energy:', energy.item())
    print('Force:', force.squeeze())





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Energy: -40.45979070350399
    Force: tensor([[ 0.048, -0.130, -0.055],
            [-0.135,  0.158, -0.078],
            [ 0.080, -0.039,  0.039],
            [ 0.025,  0.008,  0.043],
            [-0.018,  0.004,  0.051]])




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-64

you can also get the atomic energies (WARNING: these have no physical
meaning) by calling:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-66

.. code-block:: default

    _, atomic_energies = model.atomic_energies((species, coordinates))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-70

this gives you the average (shifted) energies over all models of the ensemble by default,
with the same shape as the coordinates. Dummy atoms, if present, will have an
energy of zero

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-72

.. code-block:: default

    print('Average Atomic energies, for species 6 1 1 1 1', atomic_energies)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Average Atomic energies, for species 6 1 1 1 1 tensor([[-38.080,  -0.581,  -0.591,  -0.605,  -0.604]],
           grad_fn=<MeanBackward1>)




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-74

you can also access model specific atomic energies

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-76

.. code-block:: default

    _, atomic_energies = model.atomic_energies((species, coordinates), average=False)
    print('Atomic energies of first model, for species 6 1 1 1 1', atomic_energies[0, :, :])




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Atomic energies of first model, for species 6 1 1 1 1 tensor([[-38.084,  -0.580,  -0.590,  -0.603,  -0.603]],
           grad_fn=<SliceBackward0>)
