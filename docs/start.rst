Installation
============

The installation of TorchANI is very simple. You just need to clone the git
repository and do ``pip install .`` like when you install other software.
But keep in mind that TorchANI requires master branch of PyTorch. If you do
not have master branch PyTorch installed, you should install it before
installing TorchANI. Refer to PyTorch's `official instruction`_ to compile
install PyTorch.
